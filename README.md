# Gator 🦅

Gator is a **command-line RSS feed aggregator** built with Node.js/TypeScript and PostgreSQL.  
It allows multiple users to register, add feeds, follow/unfollow feeds, and view aggregated posts straight in the terminal.

---

## 🚀 Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+)
- PostgreSQL database

---

## 🛠️ Setup

1. **Clone the repo & install dependencies**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Taijaun/Gator.git
   cd Gator
   npm install

2. **Configure your database**
    Create a PostgreSQL database and note its connection URL (e.g. 		 
    postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/gatordb).

3. **Create a config file**
    In the project root, create drizzle.config.ts (or .js) to point Drizzle at your DB:

   import { defineConfig } from "drizzle-kit";

    export default defineConfig({
    schema: "src/db/schema.ts",
    out: "src/gen",
    dialect: "postgresql",
    dbCredentials: {
    url: "postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/gatordb",
  },
});

4. **Run migrations (with Drizzle Kit)**

    npx drizzle-kit generate --config ./drizzle.config.ts
    npx drizzle-kit push --config ./drizzle.config.ts

⚙️ Running the CLI

Use npm run start (or install globally) and run:

node ./dist/index.js <command> [args]

Or (if TS support is configured):

npx tsx ./src/index.ts <command> [args]
